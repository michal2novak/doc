# Organizations

Organize your structure with organizations - which can be then connected with users, projects, etc. The organizations will also help you for a better overview at each site (by drop-down selector).

Compulsory fields:

_Name_ and _Full Name_ - is chosen by you (alphanumeric, 3-30 characters; dot, dash and underscore are allowed)

_Discount Rate_ - is in percents and values can be between 0 - 1000, where 100 is default value.  If you set the value to 70, it means 30% discount, value 130 means 30% charge. This is only for external billing.

All these can be changed after adding a new organization when editing it.

_Organization_ - choose organization for your profile

_Profile Name_ - name for your kubernetes profile (3-30 characters)

#### Octavia

Exposes the Service externally using the load balancers from OpenStack.

**Enable Taikun Load Balancer**

Manage your traffic, only available for OpenStack and Octavia disabled.

#### Proxy on bastion

Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port, the NodePort. You'll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting \<NodeIP>:\<NodePort>.

**Allow Scheduling on Master**

Schedule Pods on control-plane node to maximize resource usage, but we do not recommend it

# Flavor Info

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use a flavor for Server in Project, you have to assign the flavor to the project first. You can do so during [project creation](https://itera.gitbook.io/taikun/user-guide-1/partner/projects/creating-a-new-project) or in Flavor Info tab.
{% endhint %}



#### Bind To Project

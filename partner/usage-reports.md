# Usage Reports

_Select organization_ for a better overview of Projects_._

For every _Project_  you can see its _TCU_ for time period limited by _Start Date_ and _End Date_.

Sort data by _Project_ or _TCU_ and filter them by choosing available or deleted projects.



**TCU**

* Taikun Compute Unit
* &#x20;total CPUs and GB of RAM used in Project (TCU = CPU + RAM (in GB))

As you can see, the _Total TCU_ changes immediately.

Clicking the project will redirects you to project's info (naturally works only for available projects).

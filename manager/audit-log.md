# Audit Log

You get real-time notification via [**Bell**](https://itera.gitbook.io/taikun/user-guide-1/manager/dashboard/tables#recent-events):bell:but you can also preview all the changes made in **Audit Log**.

See who (_User Name_) made a change (_Category_, _Message_), where (_Project_) and what time (_When_). Choose _Start date_ and _End date_, _Hours_ and _Minutes_ for filtering if needed.

# Cloud Credentials

See all projects for each hosting provider:

* AWS
* Azure
* OpenStack

![Fig. 1: Cloud Credentials](<../.gitbook/assets/cc (3).gif>)

Cloud can be empty but also may include multiple projects. Each Cloud has different specifics, can be sorted differently and some columns can be expanded.

You can expand all tables to see the last modification made (_Created By_, _Last Modified_, _Last Modified By_).

### Requirements for OpenStack

{% hint style="danger" %}
For a good working OpenStack in Taikun, you have to create image in OpenStack. Requirement is an Ubuntu 20 image and we recommend using a recent kernel, e.g. a base Ubuntu image with hwe kernel here: [https://repo.itera.io/repository/images/taikun-image.qcow2](https://repo.itera.io/repository/images/taikun-image.qcow2)

To use the image in Taikun you have to use two **tags** "taikun" and "ubuntu{number}‚Äù. By default Taikun will take image with the latest {number}.

Command to add an image to openstack:

`openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public --tag taikun --tag ubuntu20.04 --property hw_disk_bus=scsi --property hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi taikun-focal-image --file taikun-image.qcow2`
{% endhint %}

# Servers

#### Sorting and Accessing Server

You can find specific server with adjusting the _CPU_, _RAM_ and _Disk_ _Size_ bars. Or the servers can be sorted by _Project Name_, _Server Name_, _Organization Name_, _Role_ (Bastion, Kubemaster, Kubeworker), _Status_ (Ready, Updating, Failure), _Kubernetes Health_ or _Creation Time_. The search bar can help you find the specific server, too.

To access server details, click _Project Name._
